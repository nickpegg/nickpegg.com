Want to share what you're doing with another person logged into the same system? All you need is a FIFO, cat, and script.

On your session:
        mkfifo foo
        script -f foo

On the viewer's session:

        cat foo

The viewer can then see everything that you're doing as if they're looking over your shoulder!
