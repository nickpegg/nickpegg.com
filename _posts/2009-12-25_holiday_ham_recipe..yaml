title: Holiday Ham Recipe
---
I don't cook/bake all that often, but when I do I like to have some fun
with it. I came up with a ham recipe that turned out well, so I figured
I'd share it with everyone.

First, put your ham in a baking pan and cut the diamond pattern into it. Trust
Alton Brown when he says that utility knives work well for this. Then, mix the
following in a bowl

* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
* 4 ounces of fine bourbon. My preference is Maker's Mark.

Once you have that all mixed up, pack it gently onto the ham. Uniformity is nice,
but not required. Then cook the ham at 325 degrees Fahrenheit until the inside
meat temperature reaches 150 degrees (about 3 hours with a 20 pound ham). I
guarantee that it'll be tasty when it's done.
