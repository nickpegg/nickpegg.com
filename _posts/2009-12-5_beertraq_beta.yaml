title: Beertraq Beta!
---
I'm glad to announce that my recent pet project, Beertraq, is now in a
(somewhat closed) beta stage! The basic idea is there and functioning,
but the extra functionality isn't done and it's far from polished.
Nonetheless, it's time to take her for a test drive!

So what is Beertraq, you ask? It's a way for you to keep track of which
beers you've tasted, compare those with others, read beer reviews, and
most importantly discover new beers to try. I originally got the idea
from The Flying Saucer's UFO Club, where members work toward a goal of
drinking 200 different beers. Once they complete the task, they get their
name on a plate which gets put on the wall of the bar. The cool part about
the UFO Club is that it's all computerized, using a magstripe card to login
at a kiosk in the bar. You can also log in to their website to check your
progress and read reviews on there. I figured that if The Flying Saucer can
have that system for their bar, I could do the same for the world.

If you're interested in becoming a BeerTraq beta user, send an email to
beertraq (at) beertraq (dot) com with the email address you want to use for
your account. All I ask is that you give feedback by filling out issue requests
with bugs you find or suggestions you might have.
