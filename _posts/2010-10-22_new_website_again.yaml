title: New Website (Again!)
---
Yes, it's that time of year. Time to change my website design
 _yet again_!

I got tired of dealing with Wordpress and wrote my own static page generator
in Python, dubbed [Posty](http://github.com/nickpegg/posty). I know, I'm
kind of [re-inventing the wheel](http://ringce.com/hyde) here and there
are some [really nice solutions](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) to
this problem, but why not just make something for making's sake?

Plus, I just feel _cool_ using Markdown and YAML to update my website.
