title: New Website
---
So, I've decided to redo my website again. My old one was pretty bland and
updating stuff was a relatively a pain. Plus, I seem to be doing more interesting
things and having more interesting thoughts (hopefully) than I have in the past
couple of years. Of course, I am a Computer Engineer (aka nerd), so don't expect
to see anything like me pondering the wonders of the cosmos here. I'll probably
mostly post updates on projects I'm fiddling with, my struggles with technology,
and what I've been up to.

As you can see, I decided to go with WordPress. I used it a long time ago, but
after seeing my roommate [Ben Murrell](http://benmurrell.com/) use it on the [Missouri S&T ACM site](http://acm.mst.edu/)
and seeing what it was capable of, I went for it. Probably the most important
thing for me was the ability to have static pages and link to them in a reasonable
fashion (as you can see along the top and right sidebar). It just does everything
I want to do without too much fuss, and it looks pretty while it does it.

I'm still moving stuff from my old website and updating information, but feel
free to poke around in the meantime.
