title: New Server
---
Thanks to a generous donation from [Richard Allen](http://rsaxvc.net/), I now have a new server.

It's a Compaq Proliant DL360. From what I can tell of it's past, a place where another
friend of mine was working was getting rid of their old hardware and he snagged a bunch.
Richard got some of the servers, had no use for this one, and then gave it to me a couple
of days ago.

It's probably a first generation DL360, but that doesn't mean it sucks. It's got dual
Pentium IIIs running at 1.266 GHz each, 512 MB of RAM, and two 18.3 GB SCSI drives running
in RAID1. It's quite an upgrade from my current server, which is dual P3 450 MHz with a
little less than 512 MB of RAM. The best part of the whole thing, though, is the Remote
Insight Lights-Out Edition II card that came with it. It's a PCI-X card that redirects
video, keyboard, and mouse from the system and supplies it to a web interface. This means
that no matter where I am, I can get a physical terminal to my server. Plus, if I plug an
external power supply to it, I can even turn on my server remotely!

I'll probably be moving everything from my current server over to the new one. Since I'm
mirroring and then cutting over, there shouldn't be any problems with any of the services
that my box supplies.
