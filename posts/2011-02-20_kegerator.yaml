After getting my tax refund and being sick and tired of bottling my homebrew
beer, I've built myself a kegerator!

Details are over at my [project page](/kegerator/), or if you'd
rather just gawk at some pictures, check out the [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickpegg/sets/72157625971333921/)!
