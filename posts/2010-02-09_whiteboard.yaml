title: Whiteboard
---
If you know me personally, you know that I can be pretty scatterbrained from
time to time. I've desperately needed a whiteboard to keep my thoughts
organized, and I've finally gotten one. I know, it's not the
most exciting thing in the world to talk about, but it should be a change
in the right direction for me.

But, wait. What's this? "Beertraq Road to Stable"?

Part of why I want to get my thoughts organized is because I want a good
view of what all is left before I fully release Beertraq to the public.
With this list looming over my head (literally) it will hopefully get my
butt in gear to reach a stable release.
