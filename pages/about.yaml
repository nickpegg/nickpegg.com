By day I'm a Site Reliability Engineer on the
[Dropbox Network](https://bgp.he.net/AS19679) team, where I help provide the
tools to monitor and automate the network that syncs your files to all of your
devices.

Outside of work I'm usually found riding bikes (sometimes for long distances
carrying camping gear), wrenching on bikes, drinking too much coffee, drinking
not-too-much beer, brewing the former two, or writing code to support my
hobbies.

I'm a huge proponent of free open-source software and maintaining control of
your data.

I also enjoy coding goofy things. Here are some GitHub repos to give you an
idea:

* [A tcpdump-to-MIDI converter](https://github.com/nickpegg/tcpdump-tunes)
* [A tool to create a bizarro Twitter version of someone](https://github.com/nickpegg/bizarro_twitter)
* [butts in your chat](https://github.com/nickpegg/lita-butt)
* [Numberwang-as-a-service](https://github.com/nickpegg/numberwang)
