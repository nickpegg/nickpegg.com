By day I'm a Site Reliability Engineer on the [Dropbox Network](https://bgp.he.net/AS19679) team, where I help provide the tools to monitor and automate the network that syncs your files to all of your devices.

Outside of work I'm usually found riding bikes (sometimes for long distances carrying camping gear), wrenching on bikes, drinking too much coffee, drinking not-too-much beer, brewing the latter two, or writing code to support my hobbies.
