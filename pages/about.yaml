By day I'm a Site Reliability Engineer on the Fleet Automation team at
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), where I help provide the tools and services to
automate our datacenters, things such as server provisioning, OS installation,
server repair validation, asset management, etc.

Outside of work I'm usually found riding bikes (sometimes for long distances
carrying camping gear), wrenching on bikes, playing around with ham radio,
drinking too much coffee, or writing code to support my hobbies.

I'm a huge proponent of free open-source software and maintaining control of
your data.

I also enjoy coding goofy things. Here are some GitHub repos to give you an
idea:

* [A tcpdump-to-MIDI converter](https://github.com/nickpegg/tcpdump-tunes)
* [A tool to create a bizarro Twitter version of someone](https://github.com/nickpegg/bizarro_twitter)
* [A chatbot plugin that prints butts](https://github.com/nickpegg/lita-butt)
