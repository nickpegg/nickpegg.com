Here's a decent number of the projects I've worked on in the past, mostly 2010 and earlier.
**This is mostly ancient and you should probably check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/nickpegg) profile instead**

### Posty (2010)
Links: [GitHub](https://github.com/nickpegg/posty)

Just a little static page generator I wrote when I got sick of using
Wordpress. It's quick, it's dirty, but it does what I need it to.

I guess I'm just never satisfied with using pre-made software packages
to run my personal website.

### Beertraq (2009)
Links: [Website](https://beertraq.com/)

A website to keep track of which beers you've tried, compare with others,
read their reviews, and discover new beer. Started in the summer of 2009,
inspired by The Flying Saucer's UFO Club.

### Intelligent Drink Dispenser (2009)
(No code available, sorry)

This is my Computer Engineering Senior Design project at the University of
Missouri-Rolla. It's basically a robotic bartender which keeps track of
customers (via RFID) and their purchases. This was an idea that Richard Allen
and I have been kicking around for a few years, but it's finally come to life.

### Nick Tracker (Python, Java) (2008)
(No code available, sorry)

Keeps track of where my phone's at, which is usually where I am. Server side
script written in Python, client written in Java for the Android phone platform.
Since I've written this, two better applications have hit the Android Market,
including Google Latitude. I've stopped work on this because I don't feel like
re-inventing the wheel.

### CPU Usage Meter (2006)
Links: [Project page](/cpu-usage-meter/), [Linux source](/media/projects/cpu_meter.tar.gz)

LEDs on the front of my computer case displaying the CPU load.

### ServCheck (PHP)
Links: [servCheck.tar.gz](/media/projects/servCheck.tar.gz)

A simple service checker written in PHP. Attempts to open a socket with the
configured hosts and ports, and outputs an HTML file showing which services
are up and down. I originally wrote this for the TerminalUnix site to show what's
working and what isn't.
